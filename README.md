# Project Task - Leonardo

Through this task, we aim to assess your fundamental understanding of the concepts we work with daily.

## Our Tech Stack:
- Angular 17 – Frontend
- Asp.net 8 – Backend
- MSSQL – Database

The task is divided into three steps, where we expect you to comment on the code you implement at each step. You are free to decide the scope of the task, but it will be judged based on complexity and feasibility.

## Database
The goal in this part of the task is to set up a simple MSSQL database. You are free to choose both the structure and content. The steps are as follows:
- Create a database diagram of the desired database structure
- Create a script that produces the database from the diagram. Preferably with sample data

## Backend
The goal in this part of the task is to build a simple ASP.Net 8 backend API against the database created in the previous step. You are free to choose the architectural pattern. The steps are as follows:
- Set up a simple ASP.NET Core Web API
- Link the database and API via the "Entity Framework Core" framework
- Set up and use AutoMapper for DTO interaction
- Create controllers where you perform basic CRUD operations against a table in the database

## Frontend
The goal in this part of the task is to create a simple interface that can receive the API calls made in the previous step. The steps are as follows:
- Initiate a simple angular app
- Create a simple front page for the app, which users are greeted with
- Create tables to interact with the backend API from the previous step -> Include all CRUD operations
- Bonus: Make any API call to an external API, and use the information in your application

**After submission, we would like a walkthrough with you, to go through the code that has been created.**
